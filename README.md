# Bengaluru Home Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning application that predicts home prices in Bengaluru using linear regression. The dataset used for training the model is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate home prices in Bengaluru based on various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms, etc.
